# Lotto-generator

Link: http://lotekdasmin.cba.pl/

This application is a simple lotto-numbers generator.
User, by marking numbers from 1 to 49 chooses, which one shall be part of his cupon.
Later on, 'system' is generating six random numbers, and according to the comparision of chosen numbers and generated numbers, the result is being printed.

This project was initially intended to be a 'demo' aplication for desktop, but when I found your internship offer, I decided to make it responsive and 'cool' (I hope so it is).
